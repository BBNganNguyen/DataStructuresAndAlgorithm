# DataStructuresAndAlgorithm
- This is personal repo for me to understand more about Data Structure and Algorithm. 
- Questions and solutions from myself, internet (multiple resources like leetcode, undemy ..).
1. Reverse a String [ReversingAString](src/main/java/com/datastructures/array/ReverseAString.java):  
  The problem is that we want to reverse a T[] array in O(N) linear time complexity and we want the algorithm to be in-place as well - so the algorithm can not use additional memory!
  For example: input is [1,2,3,4,5] then the output is [5,4,3,2,1]
2. Palindrome: [Palindrome](src/main/java/com/datastructures/array/Palindrome.java))  
   "A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward"
   For example: radar or madam
   Your task is to design an optimal algorithm for checking whether a given string is palindrome or not!
3. Add 2 number: [See the description at this link](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/)
